## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
### Instruction
I aim to deconstruct famous paintings into blocky colors, showing its structure step by step. I hope to reveal how these masterpieces are built. The falling particles that continuously form the image can draw the viewer's attention to the parts being painted. Computer animation can generate these falling particles and make them converge in the correct positions, which I find very interesting.
### Examples

It is an image of the falling particles.

I will convert the famous painting provided by our assignment to the blocky colors like this.
