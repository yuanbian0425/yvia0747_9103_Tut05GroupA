## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
### Instruction
I aim to deconstruct famous paintings layer by layer, showing their structure step by step. Through the animation process, I hope to reveal how these masterpieces are built. The falling particles that continuously form the image can draw the viewer's attention to the parts being painted. Computer animation can generate these falling particles and make them converge in the correct positions, which I find very interesting.
